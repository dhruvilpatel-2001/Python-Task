# Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
# 1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
# 2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
# o	Addition
# o	Subtraction
# o	Multiplication
# o	Division
# 3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen


a=float(input('Enter the first number: '));
b=float(input('Enter the second number: '));

Add = a + b;
Sub = a - b;
Mul = a * b;
Div = a / b;

print("\n")
print('Addition =',Add);
print('Subtraction =',Sub);
print('Multiplication =',Mul);
print('Division =',Div);
